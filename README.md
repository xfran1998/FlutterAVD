Change from 2-3 min startup emulator open android studio every time you want to test your apps to 2 sec.

You can use or change the program as you want.

You can downlaod avdRun.exe so you don't have to compile the file, I may migrate the code to classes if needed in the future so this will be easer than compiling the project.

There is a Simple version (That's what I usually use) if you know that you want to use just 1 android device every time I recommend using this version so it save you to choose the device every time you want to start your emulator, just click and run.

I hope this help you to speed up your projects.
