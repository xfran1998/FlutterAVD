You can use and change the program as you want.

I will fix any errors or update this if a good idea is proposed so feel free to help this tiny project ^.^ .

There is a Simple version (That's what I usually use) if you know that you want to use just 1 android device every time I recommend using this version so it save you to choose the device every time you want to start your emulator, just click and run.

I hope this help you to speed up your projects.
